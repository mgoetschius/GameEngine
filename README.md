This is the source code for a game engine I'm working on as a personal/educational project.  It is, of course, a work in progress.

It is dependant upon:
GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/)
GLM (http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html)
GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
stb_image.h (https://github.com/nothings/stb)
ASSIMP (http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_downloads.html)
Bullet Physics (http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/)
